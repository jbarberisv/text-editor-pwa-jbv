# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
I developed a PWA application that can be installed in a device, it utilizes indexedDB and service worker to manage the application in an offline inviroment. A at this moment the data is stored and readen in the local computer but in the future could be developed a new feature to store the data in the server using for example mysql.
